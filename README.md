## About

Shikwasa is an **ultra-lightweight**, **dependency-free** web audio player born for podcast. You may enjoy a podcast with occasional playback controls to get the best listening experience, just like I do - tweaking with handy forward/backward or speed buttons. But chances are traditional html audio players don't offer them - who would play music on 1.5x speed?

### What does Shikwasa mean?

In case you wonder, it's the name of a popular citrus fruit from Okinawa, Japan. üçä

## Installation
`npm install shikwasa`

## Usage
1. Specify a container for the player to be injected into. For example:
   ```html
   <div class="elementOfYourChoice">
   /* this is where the player will be placed */
   </div>
   ```
2. Create an instance of the player
   ```javascript
   // a detailed init example

   const player = new Shikwasa({
     fixed: {
       type: 'auto',
       position: 'bottom',
     },
     container: document.querySelector('.elementOfYourChoice'),
     transitionSpeed: 3,
     themeColor: '#00869B',
     autoPlay: false,
     muted: false,
     preload: 'metadata',
     speedOptions: [0.5, 0.75, 1.25, 1.5],
     audio: {
       title: 'Hello World!',
       artist: 'Shikwasa FM',
       cover: 'image.png',
       src: 'audio.mp3',
     },
   })
   ```

If `container` has any child nodes, it will be cleared before Shikwasa mounts. *Note: For now, only one player per page is supported.*

## Methods

```javascript
// play the current audio
player.play()

// pass a designated audio object to play it immediately
player.play({
  title: 'Embrace the universe with a cup of shikwasa juice',
  artist: 'Shikwasa',
  cover: 'image.png',
  src: 'sourceAudio.mp3'
})

// pause the current audio
player.pause()

// toggle audio play state between play and pause
player.toggle()

// destroy player
player.destroy()
```
