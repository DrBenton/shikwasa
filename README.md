## About

Shikwasa is a web audio player born for podcast. You may enjoy a podcast with occasional playback controls to get the best listening experience, just like I do - tweaking with handy forward/backward or speed buttons. But chances are traditional html audio players don't offer them - who would play a music on 1.5x speed?

### What does Shikwasa mean?

In case you wonder, it's the name of a popular citrus fruit from Okinawa, Japan. üçä

## Installation
`npm install shikwasa`

## Usage
1. Specify a container for the player to be injected into. For example:
   ```html
   <div class="elementOfYourChoice">
   /* this is where the player will be placed */
   </div>
   ```
2. Create a new instance
   ```javascript
   const player = new Shikwasa({
     fixed: {
       type: 'auto',
       position: 'bottom',
     },
     container: document.querySelector('.elementOfYourChoice'),
     transitionDuration: 5000,
     themeColor: '#00869B',
     autoPlay: false,
     muted: false,
     preload: 'metadata',
     speedOptions: [0.5, 0.75, 1.25, 1.5],
     audio: {
       title: 'Hello World!',
       artist: 'Shikwasa FM',
       cover: 'image.png',
       src: 'audio.mp3',
     },
   })
   ```

Note: For now, only one player per page is supported.

## Methods

// play the current audio
player.play()

  artist: 'Shikwasa',
  cover: 'image.png',
  src: 'sourceAudio.mp3'
})
